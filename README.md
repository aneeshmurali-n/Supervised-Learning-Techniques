# Supervised-Learning-Techniques
This project contains a notebook demonstrating various supervised learning techniques. The goal is to implement and compare different machine learning models for a given dataset to achieve optimal predictive performance.
## Contents:
* Supervised_learning_techniques.ipynb: Jupyter notebook detailing the step-by-step process of applying supervised learning models to a dataset.
* Explanation of different models and their evaluation.
## Requirements:
To run this project locally, you need the following:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
* Dataset: Use the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.
## Required libraries:
* scikit-learn
* pandas  
* numpy 
* matplotlib [Optional]
* seaborn [Optional]

### You can install the necessary libraries via pip:
In Google Colab, many common libraries are pre-installed, so you generally don't need to use pip to install them.
```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
## Models Implemented:
The following supervised learning models are explored:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Results and Evaluation:
Each model is evaluated based on the following metrics:
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score

The results are compared to find the best performing model for the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.
and which algorithm performed the best and which one performed the worst.
